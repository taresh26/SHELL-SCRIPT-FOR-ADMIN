
Explanation

Script Parameters:

DIRECTORY: Directory where the test data will be generated.
FILE_SIZE: Size of each individual file (e.g., 100).
SIZE_UNIT: Unit for file size (e.g., MB, GB, TB).
TOTAL_SIZE: Total size of data to generate (e.g., 10).
TOTAL_SIZE_UNIT: Unit for total size (e.g., MB, GB, TB).
Size Conversion:

Converts file and total size from the specified unit to bytes.
Data Generation:

Uses the dd command to generate random data files of the specified size.
How to Use the Script
Save the Script:

Save the script to a file named generate_test_data.sh.

Make It Executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x generate_test_data.sh
Run the Script:

Execute the script with the required parameters:

bash
Copy code
./generate_test_data.sh /path/to/data 100 MB 10 GB
This command will create files of size 100 MB each and generate a total of 10 GB of data in the specified directory.

Additional Information
Directory Creation: The script creates the target directory if it does not already exist.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling to manage issues like invalid size units or failures in file creation.
Data Source: Uses /dev/urandom to generate random data, which may be slow for large files. For faster data generation, consider using a different data source if available.
This script helps simulate data for backup testing or similar scenarios by generating a significant amount of test data in a controlled manner. Adjust the parameters as needed to fit your specific testing requirements.
